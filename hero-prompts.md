## Key Page Heroes (optional)

### Vibe Coding
> Art deco figure at a terminal, but the screen's glow casts shadows that write their own code on the walls

### True Cost of Free
> Art deco gift box, beautiful and ornate, but casting an impossibly long shadow filled with fine print

### Supply Chain
> Art deco train station where the tracks branch infinitely, each path carrying different cargo into darkness

### When Scripts Become Software

## Style Notes

- Keep the geometric precision of art deco
- Gold, brass, deep blues, and amber tones
- Dramatic lighting with strong shadows
- Suggest complexity without overwhelming detail
- Let negative space do work
