### When You Need to Evaluate a Dependency

1. Check the [New Dependency Checklist](checklists.md#new-dependency-checklist)
2. Review [Evaluating Dependencies](../concepts/evaluating-dependencies.md) for the framework
3. Use [Tools: Dependency Analysis](tools.md#dependency-analysis) for inspection

### When You Need to Respond to a Vulnerability

1. Check if you're affected using your SBOM (see [SBOM chapter](../security/sbom.md))
2. Follow the [Vulnerability Response Workflow](../security/vulnerability-management.md#the-vulnerability-response-workflow)
3. Update using the [Dependency Update Checklist](checklists.md#dependency-update-checklist)

### When You're Starting a New Project

1. Review [The Build Environment](../concepts/build-environment.md)
2. Set up dependency management ([Versioning and Lock Files](../concepts/versioning-and-lockfiles.md))
3. Configure vulnerability scanning ([Security Practices](../security/security-practices.md))
4. Consider ecosystem-specific guidance in [Appendices](../appendices/index.md)
